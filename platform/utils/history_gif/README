# Create a gif of the matrix history

Perform the following steps to create a gif out of the recorded matrix history.
Ensure that the HISTORY container is set up and running, otherwise you can't
use this.

## Requirements

Python requirements can be installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

In addition, the following programs are required:
- google-chrome
- gifsicle (for optimized gifs)

Also, you need to make sure that the history directory can be read without
root permissions.

### Problems with Chromium in 2023

In 2023, I was not able to take proper fullscreen screenshots with Chromium
and had to download Google Chrome:

```
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
```

To switch back to chromium, either modify the `make_gif` function in `make_gif.py` or set the environment variable `CHROME_CMD` to `chromium`.

## Run

You need:
- The location of the mini internet config (to get relationships etc.)
- The location of the config and matrix history repo.
  (This code goes through all commits to fetch changes)
- And approximate time how long you want the gif to run, e.g. `12`.
- And how many additional seconds you want to hold the final frame, e.g. `3`.

Then run:

```
python make_gif.py --run=12 --hold=3
```

You can use the `--config` and `--history` flags if the config dir and history
repo are not in their default locations.

You can use `--filter` to remove changes below 1%.

Parsing the history for the first time can easily take 15-30 minutes,
but afterwards all results are chached and changes to the gif can be made quickly.

## Development notes

The utility functions in [utils/](utils) are largely copied from the mini
internet project webserver, but adjusted for the config repository.
This one saves the output of `show ip route` instead of `show ip bgp`, so we
need to extract the paths manually.

Ideally, we would have the processed info stores somewhere so we can just fetch
it here, but for now we re-use the code.
